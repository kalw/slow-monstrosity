            <h1>What is this site?</h1>
            <p>This is a static website made by <a href="http://www.georgestefanis.com">me</a> as a test subject for improvement performance on the web
                and applying other best practices. The idea came after watching a couple of videos from <a href="http://jsconf.eu">JSConfEU 2014</a>
                by <a href="http://addyosmani.com/blog/">Addy Osmani</a> and <a href="http://www.patrickhamann.com/">Patrick Hamann</a> talking about
                performance improvement tooling and performance improvement best practices (mostly for CSS by Patrick Hamann).</p>
                <p>After getting all excited about all the new tools and the best practices i wanted to test those things on a website. Even though
                the web is full of slow websites, having access to the full source code of it is not a simple thing. So what i did was create this site instead.
                Here i'm trying to make this site as slow as possible by applying as many anti-patterns as possible. The target is to get a very low score on
                <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/">Google pagespeed insights</a> and in tools like <a href="http://yslow.org/">yslow</a>.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="sec-panel" id="tech-used">
            <h1>Technologies Used</h1>

            <p>When slow websites come in mind i always think of bloated frameworks used wrong and big libraries like Jquery. So in order to make this website slow and bloated i'll be using: </p>

            <ul>
              <li><a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a></li>
              <li><a href="http://jquery.com/download/">JQuery</a></li>
              <li><a href="http://jqueryui.com/">JQuery UI</a></li>
            </ul>

            <p> and we'll be calling some APIs as well to simulate a more real world application. All of the above frameworks are used with any optimasation whatsoever. It's the full flavored frameworks. You know what to do! ;) </p>
        </section>

        <section class="sec-panel" id="now-what">
            <h1>Now What?</h1>

            <p> Now you should be diving in and try to improve the performance of this website. You can find the source code at <a href="https://github.com/skywritergr/slow-monstrosity/">Github.</a> Also I'd advice you to watch the videos i linked above and also get familiar with performance improving tools like Google pagespeed, YSlow or anything that you believe will help you to improve the performance.</p>

            <p>Also this website has some responsive design elements in it, but it can certainly be improved. Google now uses a mobile friendly ranking to display the results on their search so i'd expect that you'll want to work on that as well. After you're done with improving feel free to <a href="https://twitter.com/stefanisg">send me a tweet</a> on Twitter with how much you improved that website and a link with your code!</p>
